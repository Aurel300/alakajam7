Theme: Tower

Game synopsis: You play as Ra(s)punzel, a prince(ss) locked in a tower. Standard fairy tale canon â€“ a prince(ss) comes to rescue you so you drop your (facial) hair. The tower is very tall however, so your hair needs to dodge many obstacles on the way down. The gameplay is in fact an infinite score attack, with the difficulty and speed increasing.
